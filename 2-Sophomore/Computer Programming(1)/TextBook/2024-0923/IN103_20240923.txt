Homework 1

Use the standard input for inputs and standard output for outputs.
Typically, the standard input comes from your keyboard, and the standard
output goes to the screen.

So just use cin to read and cout to write.

Deadline for the 1st version: 9/30
Deadline for revisions: 10/14

You may revise for an unlimited number of times.

As long as your first version is on time, your homework 1 is on time.
As long as your final version is correct, your homework 1 is correct.

Do not submit essentially empty programs (like Hello, World!) to the portal.
They do not count.

Some people used to interpret the existence of a deadline for revisions as
saying that it suffices to submit a program only on the deadline of
revisions---This is wrong.

=============================================================

for loops

int main()
{
   int i;

   for ( i = 0; i < 3; i++ )
      cout << "Hi\n";
}

int main()
{
   int i;

   for ( i = 0; i < 3; ++i )
      cout << "Hi\n";
}

for ( initialization; conditionToRunTheNextIteration; updating )

===============================================

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
   for ( int i = 0; i < 3; i++ )
      cout << "Hi\n";
}

This time, the variable i can be seen from only within the for loop.
We say that the scope of i is within the for loop.

int main()
{
   for ( int i = 0; i < 3; i++ )
      cout << "Hi\n";

   i = 9; // compilation error
}

==========================================================

Environment: You may try any of Visual Studio, Cygwin, MinGW, Borland C++,
Dev C++, g++ or any other environment that gives you a C++ compiler.

============================================================

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // #include <math.h>
#include <cstdlib> #include <stdlib.h>

<iostream> means input output stream

Back in the C language, if we want to use pow, we include <math.h>, where h
stands for header.

C is a predecessor of C++. Every standard header of C can be used in C++.
But people usually change <math.h> to <cmath>, <stdlib.h> to <cstdlib>, etc.

=============================================

Why "double"?

Oh, it is a double precision floating-point number.

=================================================

do-while loops

==================================================

   char grade; // character type, just like int or double
   int aCount = 0;
   int bCount = 0;
   bool flag = true; // declares a variable of type bool and with flag
   // boolean

Above, we see two more data types, just like int or double.
char means character.
bool means boolean (true or false).

To write down a single character, use single quotes.
For example, 'A' or 'a'.
Do not write 'AB' because AB consists of two characters.

   while ( flag )
   {
      cin >> grade;

      switch ( grade )
      {
         case 'A':
         case 'a':
            ++aCount;
            break;
         case 'B':
         case 'b':
            ++bCount;
            break;
         case 'Q':
         case 'q':
            flag = false;
            break;
         default:
            cout << "Please enter A or B, or Q to quit" << endl;
            break;
      }
   }

   cout << "Number of A\'s is " << aCount << endl;
   cout << "Number of B\'s is " << bCount << endl;

The most common error is forgetting to break (so that the program will
directly proceed on to the next case).

It is recommended to provide a default case always, even if the program
shall never reach it.
For example, you may output an error message in the default case if the
program shall not go there.
